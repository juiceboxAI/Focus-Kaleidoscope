# Focus-Kaleidoscope
Simple tool to help with focus, or to help destress. Uses light and sound. 

Focus Kaleidoscope — Brain Hygiene Suite

Patterns + light + sound to de-stress, smooth attention, and spark creativity.
Single-file web app. Local. Offline. No data leaves your machine.

Quick Start
Download focus-kaleidoscope-v2.1.1.html.
Open in Chrome/Edge/Firefox.
Pick a Preset → press Start.
Optional: enable Audio (headphones for Binaural).
Safety: Pulsed visuals and audio can bother some users. If you have photosensitivity or a seizure history, keep Entrainment OFF. 40 Hz is experimental.

Core Features
Mandala engine with symmetry, complexity, and speed controls.
Visual entrainment (6/8/10/20/40 Hz) with smooth, sine-based pulsing.

Breathing sync
Mic Sync: maps your inhale/exhale from the mic envelope (local only).
Manual Mode: built-in 4–7 cadence with a Tap Inhale phase switch.

Audio entrainment
Binaural (headphones): L/R split around a carrier.
Isochronic: amplitude-modulated single tone.
Pure + FM: gentle frequency wobble tied to breath/pulse.
Carrier/Beat controls; Beat follows visual Hz unless overridden.
Presets: Focus, Creativity, Wind-down, Experimental.
Pomodoro: 25 m / 5 m timers with chime.
Session recorder: REC indicator + live HH:MM:SS.

Recommended Recipes
Focus: Preset Focus, Visual 8 Hz, Depth ~0.18, Audio Binaural, Carrier 200–220 Hz, Vol 10–20%.
Creativity: Preset Creativity, Visual 6 Hz, Audio Pure+FM, Carrier 220–240 Hz.
Wind-down: Preset Wind-down, Visual Off, Audio Isochronic 4–6 Hz, warm palette.

Controls (UI)
Preset / Palette: circadian-aware color sets (Morning, Creativity, Evening, Night Drive).
Symmetry / Complexity / Speed: dial visual density and motion.
Entrainment (Hz) + Depth: sets pulsing rate and intensity (gentle by design).

Breathing:
Mic Sync (On/Off) — uses your mic to follow breath.
Manual Mode (On/Off) — auto 4–7; Tap Inhale flips phase.
Audio: Mode (Off / Binaural / Isochronic / Pure+FM), Volume, Carrier, Beat.
Pomodoro: 25m / 5m / Stop.
Session: Start / Stop.

Keyboard
Space: Pause / Play
B: Toggle Mic Sync
← / →: Petals
UI: Hide/Show from the button in the panel/footer

Tips
Start shallow: Depth 0.12–0.25. Nudge up only if it feels good.
Headphones for Binaural; speakers are fine for Isochronic/Pure.
If FPS dips, the app auto-reduces complexity to stay smooth.
Night sessions: Evening palette, Visual Off, Audio 4–6 Hz low volume.

Troubleshooting
No mic sync? Browser needs mic permission; toggle Mic Off→On. Ensure no other app is using the mic.
Audio silent? Click Start first (user gesture unlocks audio). Check system output + volume slider.
Discomfort/eye strain? Lower Depth, switch to Wind-down, or turn entrainment Off.
Gamma (40 Hz) feels edgy? It’s experimental. Use short tests (3–6 min) or avoid entirely.

Privacy:
All rendering, mic processing, and audio synthesis happen locally in your browser. No network calls. No logging.

Requirements
Modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
Optional mic (for Mic Sync).
Optional headphones (for Binaural).
